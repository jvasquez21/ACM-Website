							<h1>Joining ACM</h1>
							<p>
								As the premier computer science organization at UTSA, joining ACM is one of the best
								choices you can make to build your network (and your resume) outside
								of the classroom. Extra-curricular activities are essential to getting your dream job
								and creating a fulfilling college experience, and we're here to help.
							</p>
							<p>
								There are only two steps to become a member of our chapter:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Attend our general meetings</li>
								<li><a href="dues">Pay our membership dues of $15.00 per semester</a></li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								Once you pay your dues, you will become a full member of
								ACM UTSA and enjoy all of the benefits. We strongly believe
								that membership participation is vital to creating a fun
								and engaging experience, so the only thing we ask of our
								members is to actively participate in our meetings and events.
